Things to test tomorrow: (22/10/17)

I think strip() needs to be better written perhaps. I tried fixing it, but it needs testing. Maybe comment out the rest of the nav
alg. and see if we can get a single strip going.

Need to test all those things in our declarations at the start of main.ino: for example, spin_180_time (see comments)

Main priority: get pretest() working :)

Sorry not to be there guys, I'll try and catch up on Monday.
